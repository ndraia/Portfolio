# Portfolio M.C. Arriola

### Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio! With a decade of experience as a self-taught Linux user, I have developed a deep understanding of various Linux distributions, starting from Ubuntu/Linux Mint, exploring the enterprise-focused Fedora/Red Hat Enterprises, delving into Manjaro, and finally mastering the intricacies of Arch Linux. My journey through these diverse ecosystems has equipped me with a robust skill set in system administration, server management, and automation.

In this portfolio, you’ll find a collection of my projects that demonstrate my proficiency in managing and configuring Linux environments, particularly with a focus on security and server administration.

Whether you’re here to explore my work or to connect for professional opportunities, I hope you find my projects insightful and reflective of my dedication to the Linux community.

Feel free to dive into the projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
